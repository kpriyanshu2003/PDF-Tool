# PDF Tool

Task : Create a single page website, and do the following ( styling doesn't matter )

- Two sections in a page - Left and Right
- Left

  - Form ( name, mail, phone, filename ) + upload single pdf
  - Allow two different UI for right

- Right

  - Add a UI and preview live updates
  - Right is also editable

- Once everything is done, merge pdf + right ( with filename as pdf )
- Single page pdf is no pdf uploaded

Issues:

- Right Side buttons need to be clicked twice to update the right side
